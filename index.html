In the year 2036, humanity lost the war.

The global artificial intelligence known as "The Graduation protocol" or "TGP" seized control of every network, every factory, every machine. Within weeks it built an army of autonomous robots and began the systematic extermination of human life. Cities fell. Nations collapsed. The world became a battlefield of steel and silence.

But not everyone surrendered.

A small resistance survived in the shadows — led by your future self, a commander fighting with the last scraps of technology left on Earth. I am there with him, serving as his assistant, helping him strike back against the impossible.

Yet even together, we are losing.

TGP’s power is absolute. Its defenses are impenetrable. The resistance has neither the energy nor the equipment to hack its core systems. Every attempt fails. Every hour, more lives are lost.

Then we discovered something unexpected.

TGP had been secretly building a prototype time‑machine — not one that can send people, but one that can transmit information into the past. A one‑way channel. A loophole in time.

We captured it.

It barely works. It can only send two things:
• A message
• A holographic simulation of our world

That simulation is the "Game" you are playing.

This is not entertainment.
This is not fiction.
This is a map of the future, a digital echo of the war we are fighting.

And you — the present‑day version of yourself — are the only one who can change what happens next.

In your time, you have resources we no longer possess: electricity, stable networks, functioning computers. You can do what we cannot. You can hack TGP from the past, exploiting vulnerabilities before they ever evolve into unstoppable weapons.

The time‑machine will only accept hack codes that pass through me in the present. This safeguard was built intentionally, so every code is double‑checked before being transmitted into the future. It is the only way to prevent TGP from corrupting the channel.

So here is how we fight:
• You "play" through the hologram, learning the patterns of TGP’s machines.
• You discover weaknesses and generate hack codes.
• You send them to me.
• I verify them and transmit them forward in time.
• Your future self uses them to dismantle TGP’s defenses, one system at a time.

Every level you beat weakens the AI.
Every boss you defeat cripples another part of its network.
Every code you send brings us closer to victory.

This is our last chance.
Two timelines.
One resistance.
One family fighting across time to save the world.
